# Battery solution

When we first performed measurements in the Arctic (2015), we used 'cold-proof' lead-acid batteries. Our experience is that those batteries are cold-proof as long as they stay charged at above typically 80 percents (this is why you can use them for a snowscooter or a car), but freeze and get irremediably damaged whenn their charge gets lower. Therefore, we moved to a better solution in 2016.

## LiFe batteries

In 2016 we used industrial quality, prismatic Lithium Iron batteries. So far we are very happy about them.

We bought them form batteryspace (excellent customer service in our experience): http://www.batteryspace.com/

- The cells we used are LiFeMnPO4 prismatic cells, 3.2V, 40Ah, 10C rate (we usually use 2 in series to get 6.4V before low dropout voltage regulator): http://www.batteryspace.com/lifepo4-prismatic-module-3-2v-40-ah-10c-rate-128-wh-----un38-3-passed-dgr.aspx

- When using Lithium batteries you must use a Protection Circuit Module (PCM) adapted to your battery technology. We used this one:

- You will also need a balancing charger specifically designed for LiFe batteries. For us, the cheapest alternative was to buy chargers typically used by RC modelists: SkyRc E4 LiPo/Life Balanseringslader 2-4S 220V, http://elefun.no/p/prod.aspx?v=23935
